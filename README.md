AI Hackathon:  Education (Mental Health and Well Being)


# Mood2Math 🧠📊  
**Early Mental-Health Detection for Academic Success**

Mood2Math is a data-driven tool that helps schools **identify mental-health risks early** and prevent academic decline, with a focus on mathematics performance.

Built at **Hi!ckathon 2025**.

---

## 🚩 Problem

Mental-health issues (stress, bullying, digital addiction, unstable home environments) are:
- widespread among students
- largely invisible to schools
- often detected only after academic failure or crisis

Existing school platforms track grades and attendance — **not wellbeing**.

---

## 💡 Solution

Mood2Math provides a **simple, explainable, and scalable** monitoring system.

**How it works**
1. Students complete a short questionnaire
2. Answers are mapped to **5 wellbeing pillars**
3. Pillars are scored (0–100)
4. A transparent threshold system classifies risk
5. Alerts are routed to the right school staff

---

## 🧩 Wellbeing Pillars

- Stress  
- Bullying  
- Home Environment  
- Teacher Relationship  
- Digital Addiction  

Displayed together on a **radar chart** for instant interpretation.

---

## 🚦 Risk Classification

- **Green**: safe zone  
- **Orange**: moderate risk  
- **Red**: high risk  

Thresholds are **rule-based and fully explainable** (no black box).

---

## 🧭 Automatic Routing

Each pillar is linked to the appropriate support:
- Psychologist
- Nurse
- Dean
- Student Welfare Office
- Teaching team

This enables **fast, targeted intervention**.

---

## 📈 Scientific Validation

We validated the approach by predicting **MathScore** using PISA-like survey data.

- Models tested: Ridge/Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost
- Best performance: **XGBoost + CatBoost ensemble**
- Key result: wellbeing indicators are strong predictors of math performance

This confirms that academic decline is often a **signal of underlying distress**.

---

## 🏫 Deployment

- Web-based, no hardware
- Integrates with ENT platforms
- Minimal training
- Suitable for schools, academies, and regional deployment

---

## 💼 Business Model
